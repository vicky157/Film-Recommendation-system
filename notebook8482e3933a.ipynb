In my first notebook ( [The Story of Film](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-story-of-film/) ), I attempted at narrating the story of film by performing an extensive exploratory data analysis on Movies Metadata collected from TMDB. I also built two extremely minimalist predictive models to predict movie revenue and movie success and visualise which features influence the output (revenue and success respectively).\n\nIn this notebook, I will attempt at implementing a few recommendation algorithms (content based, popularity based and collaborative filtering) and try to build an ensemble of these models to come up with our final recommendation system. With us, we have two MovieLens datasets.\n\n* **The Full Dataset:** Consists of 26,000,000 ratings and 750,000 tag applications applied to 45,000 movies by 270,000 users. Includes tag genome data with 12 million relevance scores across 1,100 tags.\n* **The Small Dataset:** Comprises of 100,000 ratings and 1,300 tag applications applied to 9,000 movies by 700 users.\n\nI will build a Simple Recommender using movies from the *Full Dataset* whereas all personalised recommender systems will make use of the small dataset (due to the computing power I possess being very limited).

For one, it gives the same recommendation to everyone, regardless of the user's personal taste. If a person who loves romantic movies (and hates action) were to look at our Top 15 Chart, s/he wouldn't probably like most of the movies. If s/he were to go one step further and look at our charts by genre, s/he wouldn't still be getting the best recommendations.\n\nFor instance, consider a person who loves *Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge*, *My Name is Khan* and *Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham*. One inference we can obtain is that the person loves the actor Shahrukh Khan and the director Karan Johar. Even if s/he were to access the romance chart, s/he wouldn't find these as the top recommendations.\n\nTo personalise our recommendations more, I am going to build an engine that computes similarity between movies based on certain metrics and suggests movies that are most similar to a particular movie that a user liked. Since we will be using movie metadata (or content) to build this engine, this also known as **Content Based Filtering.**\n\nI will build two Content Based Recommenders based on:\n* Movie Overviews and Taglines\n* Movie Cast, Crew, Keywords and Genre\n\nAlso, as mentioned in the introduction, I will be using a subset of all the movies available to us due to limiting computing power available to me.

They are as follows:\n\n1. **Simple Recommender:** This system used overall TMDB Vote Count and Vote Averages to build Top Movies Charts, in general and for a specific genre. The IMDB Weighted Rating System was used to calculate ratings on which the sorting was finally performed.\n2. **Content Based Recommender:** We built two content based engines; one that took movie overview and taglines as input and the other which took metadata such as cast, crew, genre and keywords to come up with predictions. We also deviced a simple filter to give greater preference to movies with more votes and higher ratings.\n3. **Collaborative Filtering:** We used the powerful Surprise Library to build a collaborative filter based on single value decomposition. The RMSE obtained was less than 1 and the engine gave estimated ratings for a given user and movie.\n4. **Hybrid Engine:** We brought together ideas from content and collaborative filterting to build an engine that gave movie suggestions to a particular user based on the estimated ratings that it had internally calculated for that user.\n\nPrevious -> [The Story of Film](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-story-of-film/)","metadata":{"_uuid":"ad1edcae8eecd5c725edbe18082bc4d8103ca800","_cell_guid":"812fc4c7-b334-4f54-a05f-8fc0e7962a92"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"_uuid":"e53889f19f6d352bb0418567941dff8f9e57da41","_cell_guid":"304b0809-4070-4954-99ed-203a4b8b6956","collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
